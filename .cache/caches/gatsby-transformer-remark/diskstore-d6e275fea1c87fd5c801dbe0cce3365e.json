For instance, Python comes already installed and ready to use on Linux. I use Python for a variety of things as well as the Python package installer, pip, so when I started with this computer I installed them right away. Not sure if this makes a difference but I at least want to be able to duplicate my environment in case anyone else is struggling with this. After installing python, both versions, 2.X.X and 3.X.X, as well as pip, since they are two different programs, I made sure to do it right and add it to my 'path' or Windows environment variables so it can be found. After that, I installed NPM and a variety of other tools including the awscli, WSL, GIT, and a few more. After installing all of this through PowerShell I realized after poking around, that I could have a Linux 'environment' called Windows Subsystem Linux. Since Linux is what I was used to and felt most comfortable with, I set out to install WSL. I wanted to use WSL for all of the things I had just loaded on my machine through PowerShell, so I had to duplicate a lot of my work. I made sure python 2.X.X and 3.X.X were installed on WSL. Since WSL is similar to a virtual machine or a distro all to itself - or a 'subsystem' - I was not sure if I could share these tools between the two environments. I have set up dual boot machines as well as virtual machines before and the explanations I read made it sound like it favored these kinds of an environment. I installed pip, Node, NPM, GIT, and all the other stuff I was using at the time onto WSL.  One of the programs I use is the awscli.  This allows you to interact with AWS or Amazon Web Services.
