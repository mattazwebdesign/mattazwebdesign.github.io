          This extension does not track you in any way. Any information gathered
          about you, is stored on <b>your</b> machine. I made a point to not
          track users in any way. I even left off Google Analytics. This too,
          was one of the motivations for creating this extension. Every single
          one I looked at, had some kind of tracking and/or ads. This has
          neither. This is a Free, Open Source extension that I built and wanted
